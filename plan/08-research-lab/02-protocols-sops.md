# Protocols, SOPs & Method Versioning

> Status: implementation specification. This document is normative for this module unless the master plan explicitly overrides it.

**Master plan:** [`../README.md`](../README.md)  
**Delivery phase(s):** Phase 16  
**Related systems:** `ELN`, `inventory`, `equipment`, `audit`, `notifications`

## 1. Purpose

Defines reusable protocols/SOPs with versioning, approvals, step execution, deviations, and links to experiments.

### Success condition
The module is complete only when its primary workflows work end-to-end on phone, tablet, desktop, keyboard-only, and supported assistive technology paths; all writes are authorized server-side; data survives refresh/reconnect; error states are recoverable; and the behavior is covered by automated tests.

## 2. Scope and boundaries

- Build the complete user workflow, not only the visible page.
- Include empty, loading, success, degraded, offline where applicable, permission-denied, validation-error, and destructive-action states.
- Do not duplicate another module’s source of truth. Link to the canonical entity instead.
- Keep the module extensible through typed capabilities/events rather than hard-coded role branches.
- Every destructive or security-sensitive action must have explicit authorization, auditability where appropriate, and predictable recovery semantics.

## 3. Primary routes / surfaces

- `/lab/protocols`
- `/protocol/:id`

Every route must support direct linking, refresh, browser back/forward navigation, authentication return-to behavior, and a valid not-found / no-access state.

## 4. Domain model

Primary entities:

- `Protocol`
- `ProtocolVersion`
- `ProtocolStep`
- `Approval`
- `ExecutionInstance`
- `Deviation`

### Required entity conventions

- Stable opaque ID; never expose sequential IDs as an authorization boundary.
- Workspace/tenant scope on every workspace-owned row.
- `created_at`, `updated_at`, creator/updater identity where meaningful, and optimistic concurrency/version field for contested writes.
- Soft-delete/retention semantics when the object is recoverable; hard deletion only through the deletion pipeline.
- Audit events for permission changes, destructive actions, sensitive exports, signatures, and security-relevant mutations.
- Search/index projection and activity events are derived from canonical transactional data, not the other way around.

## 6. Core user flows

- author → review → approve → immutable version
- experiment starts → bind exact protocol version → execute steps → record deviations

### Flow rules

- Preserve user context after authentication, refresh, reconnect, or recoverable failures.
- Mutations must be idempotent where retries are plausible.
- Optimistic UI is allowed only when rollback is deterministic and the server remains authoritative.
- Long-running work must leave the initiating page and continue through a job/activity model; never trap the user in a modal waiting for completion.

## 7. UI architecture

- Use the shared application shell, design tokens, dialogs/sheets, menus, toasts, skeletons, form controls, empty states, and error states.
- Keep primary actions visually stable across screen sizes; responsive adaptation may move them but must not remove them.
- Preserve a clear information hierarchy: page title/context → primary action → content → secondary metadata → destructive/admin actions.
- Use virtualization for unbounded lists/grids and progressive disclosure for advanced controls.
- Persist user view preferences only when they improve repeated use; do not create hidden state the user cannot reset.

## 8. Responsive behavior

- Bench tablet mode uses large check controls and timers
- Desktop authoring provides outline + details
- Phone supports run/check mode

### Device contract

| Width / input context | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| 320–599 px phone | Single primary pane, no horizontal page overflow, sheet/full-screen secondary surfaces, touch targets ≥44 px |
| 600–1023 px tablet | Adaptive one/two pane, stylus support where relevant, hardware-keyboard parity |
| 1024–1439 px desktop | Persistent navigation where useful, optional inspector/split view, full keyboard shortcuts |
| 1440 px+ wide | More simultaneous context, not wider unreadable text; cap prose width and use side panes |
| Any size + zoom | Must remain operable at browser zoom and OS text scaling; no clipped critical actions |

## 9. Accessibility requirements

- WCAG 2.2 AA target for product UI.
- Correct landmarks, headings, labels, names/roles/values, error association, and live-region announcements.
- Full keyboard path for every non-drawing action; visible focus; logical focus order; escape/close semantics.
- Drawing/spatial features require a meaningful non-canvas representation for critical information where feasible.
- Color is never the sole carrier of status. Respect reduced motion and contrast preferences.
- Automated checks are necessary but not sufficient: include manual keyboard and screen-reader acceptance passes on primary workflows.

## 10. Authorization and security

- Resolve actor, workspace, membership, object scope, and capability on the server for every mutation and sensitive read.
- Never trust hidden buttons, route guards, client claims, cached roles, or object IDs as authorization.
- Sanitize user-provided rich content and external embeds; validate MIME/signatures for files where applicable.
- Rate-limit abuse-prone endpoints and use idempotency keys for retryable writes.
- Emit security/audit events for access changes, destructive actions, exports of sensitive data, and policy-controlled actions.

## 11. API / service responsibilities

- Typed create/read/update/list/delete-or-archive operations with explicit permission checks.
- Cursor pagination for collections; stable sort keys; filters validated server-side.
- Concurrency control for edits that can overwrite meaningful state.
- Domain events through the transactional outbox for search, notifications, analytics, and background processing.
- Background jobs for expensive conversion, export, indexing, media processing, or bulk work; progress must be queryable.
- Consistent error envelope: code, user-safe message, recoverability, field errors where applicable, request/correlation ID.

## 12. Search, history, notifications, and analytics hooks

- Define exactly which fields are searchable and which are excluded because they are sensitive or noisy.
- Significant content changes create version/history entries according to the document/version policy.
- User-facing events generate notifications only through the preference/deduplication layer, never ad hoc emails from feature code.
- Analytics events contain IDs/categories/state transitions—not private document bodies, recordings, source identities, or sensitive research data.

## 13. Offline and synchronization behavior

- Classify each action as offline-supported, read-cache-only, or online-required.
- Offline-supported mutations must use a durable local queue with idempotent replay and visible sync state.
- Conflicts must be merged automatically only when semantics are safe; otherwise show a user-resolvable conflict rather than silently discarding data.
- Security/permission revocations override cached access on reconnect and as soon as an online client is notified.

## 14. Edge cases that must be tested

- protocol changed mid-run
- retired protocol referenced
- missing reagent
- approval revoked
- offline execution

Also test: network loss during mutation, duplicate submission, stale client version, authorization removal while open, deleted linked object, quota/plan limit, and service dependency timeout.

## 15. Performance targets

- Initial useful content should render without waiting for noncritical secondary data.
- User input/selection feedback should feel immediate; expensive persistence runs asynchronously when safe.
- Lists and grids must remain usable with large realistic datasets through pagination/virtualization.
- Avoid loading editor engines, charting libraries, or heavy integrations on routes that do not use them.
- Define module-specific p95 API and UI latency budgets before production sign-off and track them in observability.

## 16. Test plan

### Unit
- Domain validation, permission predicates, state transitions, recurrence/formula/parser logic where relevant.

### Integration
- Database constraints/transactions, API authorization, event emission, job handling, search/index updates, object-storage interactions.

### End-to-end
- Happy path plus destructive/recovery path on desktop.
- Primary path on a phone viewport and a tablet viewport.
- Keyboard-only path for all non-drawing controls.
- Refresh/reconnect midway through a meaningful edit or mutation.
- Permission loss and stale-session behavior.

## 19. Definition of done

This module is **not done** when the page merely renders. It is done when creation, retrieval, editing/action, persistence, permissions, recovery, responsive behavior, accessibility, observability, and automated verification all meet this specification and the global Definition of Done in the master plan.
